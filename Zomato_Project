Description:
A project done in Tableau that analyzes Zomato's core customer demographics and how that impacts their sales. 
	• Created 6 graphs based on various demographics (e.g. gender, education, age) and 3 graphs based on sales performance over time. 
	• Developed a 5 slide story outlined Zomato's current demographic situation and a potential solution to declining sales based on information from 2 dashboards. 

Zomato's main customer demographics are young unmarried students with no income. Sales dropping since 2018 is a major problem. However,
uneducated housewives showed the least descline in sales over. We recommend a new strategy that targets the housewife demographic in
light of declining sales from their core demographic.
