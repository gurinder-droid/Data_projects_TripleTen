Description: 
A project done in Tableau to prepare an analysis about a problem of high returns for the purposes of communicating it to an executive succinctly. 
	* Constructed 2 dashboards that included scatterplots, time series, composite bar charts, and geographic charts. 
  	* Designed a 8 slide story that provided a coherent narrative about the causes of high returns and recommendations on it can be improved. 

The scattorplot showed a low correlation between sales and total returns and the bar chart showed little difference in average
return rates between differet categories. The biggest differentiator was inbetween different region of the US. The West region has nearly double the average retunr of the next highest region. Thus, our recommendation is to look into the what is causing those differences and investigate further.
