Description: 
A project done in Power BI that reviews the app landscape on Shopify and the key factors that play into being a successful app. 
	• Built a KPI card, line chart, scattorplot analyzing average reviews with an interpretation, helpful_reviews column, developer_answered column 
	• Joined 2 tables together in a many-to-one relationship to analyze developers with sum_of_ratings, helpful_reviews, and developer_answered. 

Our results revealed that most apps have less than 10k reviews and have an average rating of at least 3. The average reviews of those considered helpful was 5.48.
