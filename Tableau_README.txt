Description:
A project done in Tableau to review the Superstore's operations and make recommendations on how it can increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy. 
	• Identified the biggest profit and loss subcategories using a heatmap
	• determined the best combination of month and state that generates the most average profit for purposes of advertising
	• Calculated product return rate to visualize which products have abnormal rates of being returned 
 	* Created an Product return rate vs Avg Profit scatterplot to visualize which sub-categories had the highest potential for profit while minimizing return rates

The two biggest profit centers are copiers in central region and chairs in east region, both at standard shipping class. The 
two biggest loss-makers are binders in central region and tables in east region, both at standard shipping class. The best 
combinations for most average profit for state and month are New York September, Washington March, and California December. The store should invest more of their resources in copiers because this sub-category's average profits are massively greater than
any other sub-category and it's return rate is moderate.
