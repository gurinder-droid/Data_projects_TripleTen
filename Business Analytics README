Description: 
A project done in Google Sheets to analyze sales data from an online site that sells electronics and offer an executive summary of its results. 
	• Created a conversion funnel by applying my knowledge of pivot tables to find the level of conversions between each stage of the sale process 
	• Preprocessed data using filters, pivot tables, and vlookup functions to prepare it for analysis 
	• Calculated customer retention rates and communicated results using an executive summary sheet that contained an quick synopsis and a more in-depth description of the analysis
