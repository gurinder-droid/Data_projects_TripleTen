Description: 
A project done in Google Sheets to analyze sales data from an online site that sells electronics and produce an executive summary of its results. 
	• Created a conversion funnel by applying my knowledge of pivot tables to find the level of conversions between each stage of the sale process 
	• Preprocessed data using filters, pivot tables, and vlookup functions to prepare it for analysis 
	• Calculated customer retention rates and communicated results using an executive summary sheet that contained an quick synopsis and a more in-depth description of the analysis
We found that only about 10% of those who viewed a product purchased it and SEPT 2020 had the highest retention rates with subsequent cohorts decreasing. 

Idea for improvement: If we have more data over more years, we could have formed stronger conclusions about trends in conversion rates and customer retention rates.
